Develop an console application that uses LINQ queries to retrieve and display data. Data is stored in binary file and represents information about the results of students tests. Information about the student contains the name of the student, the name of the test, the date of the test and the assessment of the test for this student. To work with data the information is read into a binary search tree. Provide the ability to define user criteria for viewing data. Expand the ability to work with the application in such a way that users can specify the sort order and limit the number of rows retrieved.
